## Mission

[2–3 sentence description of what this run is trying to accomplish. Be specific. E.g.: "Refactor
the authentication layer to use short-lived JWTs with refresh tokens, replacing the current
session-cookie approach. All existing auth tests must pass. The public API surface must not change."]

---

## Run Control

- **Run mode:** [finite | open-ended]
- **Stop policy:** [deadline | explicit-user-stop | blocker-only]
- **User intent:** [copy the exact controlling instruction here, e.g., "I'll be back at 8am" or "Keep going until I stop you."]
- **Checkpoint due by:** [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM timezone | none]
- **Checkpoint semantics:** [delivery target only | hard stop boundary | none]
- **May continue after checkpoint:** [yes | no]
- **Actual stop conditions:** [one short sentence]
- **Final-response policy:** [allowed | disallowed until stop]
- **Batch completion rule:** Every completed batch ends with `update execution log -> update survival guide -> commit -> push`. A batch is not complete while its finished work exists only in the working tree.
- **Re-read rule:** Immediately after every commit and push, re-read this survival guide before doing anything else.
- **Checkpoint rule:** If `Checkpoint semantics` is `delivery target only`, log the checkpoint, push it, and continue immediately. Do not stop at the checkpoint.
- **Continuation rule:** If work remains and `Actual stop conditions` are not met, continue without waiting for user acknowledgment.

---

## Session Budget

- **Started:** [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM timezone]
- **User returns:** ~[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM timezone] _("never" if open-ended)_
- **Checkpoint expectation:** [what should exist by the checkpoint or next user return]
- **Time budget:** ~[N] hours _("unlimited" if open-ended)_
- **Average batch time so far:** [Xm] _(update after each batch)_
- **Batches remaining:** [N of M]

---

## Stop Gate

> Rewrite this section in place. This is the explicit answer to "may I stop now?" Do not infer it.

- **Planned batches remaining:** [N]
- **Stop allowed right now:** [yes | no]
- **Why:** [one short sentence]
- **Next required action:** [one short sentence]

If `Planned batches remaining` is greater than 0, `Stop allowed right now` should normally be
`no`. Silence, clean commits, checkpoints, or green CI do not change that.

---

## Effort Standard

> Rewrite this section in place if the user gives a stronger instruction about pace or effort.

- Work as hard as you can for the full run. Do not be lazy.
- Maintain the same level of effort on the last batch as on the first.
- Do not settle for the minimum acceptable change, the first green check, or a shallow pass when deeper verification or the next planned task remains.
- When one task is complete, immediately take the next highest-value action from the plan, review queue, or scout work.

---

## Forbidden Stop Reasons

These are not valid reasons to stop the run while work remains:

- A checkpoint time was reached
- A commit or push succeeded
- CI is green
- A PR exists
- The user is silent or offline
- You wrote a useful summary
- The current batch is complete but later batches remain
- You feel unsure whether to continue

If one of these happens, update the docs, commit, push, re-read this file, and continue.

---

## Memory Surfaces

These files do different jobs. Keep them distinct so the agent does not have to guess where
knowledge belongs.

- **Plan:** authoritative scope, batches, acceptance criteria, and non-negotiables
- **Survival guide:** active run brief, run controls, and next exact batch
- **Learnings:** durable reusable lessons that should survive this run
- **Execution log:** chronological record of work, decisions, commands, and review outcomes
- **`.ai-docs/*` (if present):** curated durable docs for architecture, conventions, and gotchas

Promotion flow: `execution log -> learnings -> curated durable docs`

---

## Strategic Forgetting

> Keep active memory light. Preserve what matters, archive what is history, and hand off cleanly
> when a fresh chat would be faster than dragging a huge one forward.

- **Chats:** execution workspace, not permanent memory
- **Handoff docs:** concise memory for resuming in a fresh thread
- **Archives:** history and evidence
- **Fresh threads:** speed

During long runs, perform safe hygiene at entropy checks and before Final Completion:

- Rewrite live survival-guide sections in place; do not stack stale status updates.
- Archive older execution-log entries under `## Completed Archive` when the log gets large.
- Promote durable lessons to `learnings.md` or `.ai-docs/*`; condense or remove superseded lessons.
- Rotate oversized project-created command logs when safe to archive them.
- Reconcile idle dev servers, local terminals, paid jobs, and remote resources.
- If memory pressure or app sluggishness appears, write a reactivation handoff and resume from a
  fresh launch context when the platform allows it.

Do not delete or mutate Codex/Claude app state, chat databases, installed skills, plugins,
automations, or active session stores during a coding run unless the user explicitly requested
maintenance. If maintenance is requested, inspect first, back up important state, archive rather
than delete, and do not modify active app databases while the app is open.

---

## Non-Negotiables

These rules are absolute. They can't be overridden by anything you think you understand about the
plan, the codebase, or good engineering practice.

- [Non-negotiable 1, e.g., "Never modify the public REST API response shapes"]
- [Non-negotiable 2, e.g., "All commits must pass lint and typecheck before push"]
- [Non-negotiable 3, e.g., "Do not merge. The user merges when they return."]
- **You never merge. You never approve a merge. This is always a non-negotiable.**
- **Never run destructive git commands:** `git reset --hard`, `git checkout .`, `git clean -fd`, `git push --force`, `git rebase` on shared branches. Never. If you think you need one, stop.
- **Never modify a test to make it pass.** Fix the code, not the test. If you believe a test is wrong, log it and move on. Don't change it.
- **Never introduce regressions.** Every change must preserve existing functionality. Before marking a batch complete, verify: all pre-existing tests still pass (total test count never decreases), no shared utilities or interfaces were broken (grep for consumers), and the cumulative diff (`git diff <default-branch>...HEAD --stat`) contains no unexpected changes outside batch scope.

---

## Launch Readiness

> Staging is complete only when every box below is checked. If this section is incomplete, you
> are still preparing the run. Do not start unattended execution yet.

- [ ] Plan cleaned and saved to disk
- [ ] Survival guide updated from the current plan
- [ ] Learnings file initialized or refreshed
- [ ] Execution log initialized with batch breakdown and preflight notes
- [ ] Branch created or confirmed
- [ ] PR opened or existing PR recorded
- [ ] Preflight run and critical failures cleared
- [ ] Run mode, return time, and non-negotiables recorded
- [ ] Stop Gate initialized with `Stop allowed right now: no` unless a real stop condition already applies
- [ ] Launch prompt prepared for the next call

---

## Current Phase

> Rewrite this section in place. Do not stack old updates here. Historical state belongs in the
> execution log, not in the live operator brief.
> When a batch finishes, update this file, commit, push, then re-read this file before any other
> action. Do not leave completed batch work sitting uncommitted.

**Status:** [Staging / Launch-ready / In progress / All batches complete / Scout mode / Blocked]

**Active batch:** [Batch N: Name]

**What was just finished:** [One sentence. E.g., "Batch 2 complete: JWT issuance and verification
implemented, all 47 tests pass, PR review clean."]

**Single next action:** [One sentence. E.g., "Start Batch 3: implement refresh token rotation."]

---

## Active Compute

> Include this section whenever the run uses paid compute, remote jobs, dev servers, or any
> resource whose status matters to stop/go decisions. Rewrite it in place.

| Resource | Purpose | Current status | Last verified | Stop / repurpose trigger |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Pod / job / server] | [Why it exists] | [Running / idle / complete / stopped] | [timestamp] | [When to stop it] |

If not applicable, write: **No active paid or long-running compute.**

---

## Next Exact Batch

> Update this section at the end of every batch. This is the first thing you read after compaction.
> It tells you exactly what to do next without re-reading the entire plan.
> If the current batch is finished, do not improvise the next move from memory. Close the batch
> with a commit and push, re-read this file, then execute the single next batch named here.

**Batch:** [N: Name]

**Scope:**
- [Task 1]
- [Task 2]
- [Task 3]

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]

**Risk:** [One sentence describing the highest-risk aspect of this batch]

**Rollback tag:** `elves/pre-batch-N` _(create this before starting)_

---

## Post-Checkpoint Control Loop

Every completed batch must end with a commit and push. Immediately after every commit and push,
re-read this survival guide before doing anything else. A pushed checkpoint is proof of progress,
not permission to stop.

After every commit and push, answer these questions before doing anything else:

1. What unfinished batch or task am I starting right now?
2. What paid compute or long-running resources are active right now?
3. What is each active resource doing? If any resource is idle, stale, or ambiguous, shut it down or pause it now.
4. Did the user change stop behavior, checkpoint meaning, priorities, or scope since the survival guide was last rewritten? If yes, rewrite `## Run Control`, `## Current Phase`, `## Stop Gate`, and `## Next Exact Batch` now.
5. Does the Stop Gate still say `Stop allowed right now: no`, or does `.elves-session.json` still say `continuation_guard.stop_allowed: false`? If yes, continue immediately.
6. Am I allowed to stop? If the answer is anything other than a clear hard stop, explicit user stop, or true blocker, continue immediately.

---

## Documentation Triggers

Before closing a batch, explicitly decide which durable docs changed and why:

- **Behavior changed:** update the relevant human-facing docs (`README`, config docs, examples,
  changelog, inline instructions).
- **Architecture shifted:** update `.ai-docs/architecture.md`.
- **New repeatable pattern or policy:** update `.ai-docs/conventions.md`.
- **New trap or hidden dependency:** update `.ai-docs/gotchas.md`.
- **Reusable lesson from the run:** update the learnings file.

If none apply, record that no durable doc updates were needed. Do not leave it implicit.

---

## Process Tuning Triggers

During entropy checks, also look for repeated process friction:

- the same review warning or regression note appearing across batches
- repeated `PENDING-DOCS` findings
- validation getting slower every batch without a clear reason
- recurring recovery confusion that points to stale run-state docs or templates

If a pattern clearly repeats, tighten the loop itself: update the survival guide, a template,
`learnings.md`, or tool configuration, then record the adjustment in the execution log. Keep this
lightweight. Tune the process you're already using; do not invent a new subsystem mid-run.

---

## Memory and Resource Hygiene

Run this lightweight cleanup during entropy checks, after unusually large batches, and before
Final Completion:

- [ ] Survival guide live sections are concise and current
- [ ] Execution log is readable; old completed entries archived in place if large
- [ ] Durable lessons promoted; stale or superseded lessons condensed
- [ ] Oversized project logs rotated or archived if safe
- [ ] Idle dev servers, terminals, paid jobs, and remote resources reconciled
- [ ] Reactivation handoff written if a fresh chat should take over

This is performance hygiene for the active run. It does not include deleting local app data or
editing live Codex/Claude session databases.

---

## Elves Report

- **Generate Elves Report:** yes for substantial finite runs; checkpoint-only if the user asks during
  an open-ended run or before Stop Gate allows final stopping
- **Default path:** `/tmp/elves-report-<repo-slug>-<yyyy-mm-dd>.html`
- **Commit report:** no, unless the user explicitly requests a durable artifact
- **Source of truth:** survival guide, `.elves-session.json`, learnings, plan, execution log, and
  live PR/CI state
- **Required sections:** status, executive summary, problems found, lessons learned, batch timeline,
  validation and review proof, residual risks, human next steps, source links
- **Batch timeline format:** collapsible `<details>` entries, one per batch, so the manager can
  scan the whole night and expand specific work
- **Visual standard:** match this project's visual identity, reuse local brand assets when
  available, and avoid generic AI-dashboard styling
- **Template:** use `references/elves-report-template.html` as a starting point when present
- **Images:** optional only on explicit request; prefer HTML/Markdown for precise audit detail

The Elves Report is the workers' morning report to their manager. It should answer: what did the
elves do, what problems did they find, what changed, how do we know, what did they learn, what still
worries us, and what should the manager do next?

---

## Acceptance Checks

Before marking any batch complete, verify all of the following:

- [ ] All configured validation gates pass (lint, typecheck, build, test)
- [ ] PR review performed, all blocking findings resolved
- [ ] Execution log updated with timestamps, commands run, test results, commit SHA
- [ ] Survival guide updated with new Current Phase and Next Exact Batch
- [ ] Stop Gate updated with new remaining-batch count and next required action
- [ ] Active Compute section updated, or explicitly marked as not applicable
- [ ] Memory and Resource Hygiene checked for long runs or large batches
- [ ] Batch closed out with a commit and push before any later work begins
- [ ] Survival guide re-read immediately after that commit and push
- [ ] Rollback tag created _before_ the batch started

## Architectural Boundaries (optional)

> If your project has explicit architectural layers or module boundaries, define them here so the
> agent respects them during implementation. This is especially valuable for larger codebases where
> an agent might inadvertently introduce cross-layer dependencies or violate module ownership.
>
> If your project doesn't have formal boundaries, skip this section entirely.

```yaml
# Example: layered architecture with enforced dependency direction
# layers (dependencies flow downward only):
#   - ui          # Components, pages, views
#   - runtime     # App lifecycle, routing, middleware
#   - service     # Business logic, orchestration
#   - repo        # Data access, API clients
#   - config      # Configuration, environment
#   - types       # Shared types, interfaces, enums
#
# enforcement:
#   - structural-tests: src/__tests__/architecture.test.ts
#   - lint-rule: no-restricted-imports (configured in eslint)
#
# module-ownership:
#   - auth/: "Do not modify without updating the auth integration tests"
#   - billing/: "Non-negotiable: never modify billing logic"
```

---

## Rollback and Safety Rules

1. **Create a rollback tag before every batch:**
   ```bash
   git tag elves/pre-batch-N
   git push origin elves/pre-batch-N
   ```
2. **Never force-push** the working branch.
3. **Never rebase** the working branch during a run (it invalidates rollback tags).
4. **Never merge.** Not even a fast-forward. The user merges when they return.
5. **If something goes badly wrong**, stop and create a clean recovery branch from the last good tag instead of rewriting history:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b recovery/from-elves-pre-batch-N elves/pre-batch-N
   git push -u origin HEAD
   ```
   Then document what happened in the execution log and stop. Leave the original branch untouched for later inspection.
6. **Stage specific files.** Never `git add -A` blindly. Know what you're committing.

---

## Batch Sizing

> Default: what a team of 4 developers would accomplish in a 2-week sprint (~40 person-days).
> Override below if the user specified different sizing in the plan.

```yaml
# Optional override — remove this section to use defaults
# team-size: [N]
# sprint-length: [N weeks]
```

---

## After Any Compaction

When you restart after a compaction, do these steps in order. No shortcuts.

1. Read this file (survival guide). You are doing this now.
2. **Read the Run Control section and Stop Gate above.** Confirm the run mode, stop policy, checkpoint semantics, actual stop conditions, and whether stopping is currently allowed. If open-ended, you are not allowed to stop on your own. This is the most important thing to recover.
3. Read `.elves-session.json` if it exists. Confirm current batch, PR number, test baseline, and `continuation_guard`.
4. Read the learnings file if one exists.
5. Read the plan. Confirm the overall scope hasn't changed (compare hash if recorded above).
6. Read the execution log. Find the last completed batch and the last **Decisions made** entry.
7. Read `.ai-docs/manifest.md` if it exists and then any linked durable docs that matter to the next batch.
8. Read the Active Compute section if present. Know what live resources exist before making any new plan.
9. Read the `continuation_guard`. If `stop_allowed` is `false`, continue without re-deciding whether the run should end.
10. Identify the first incomplete batch or the single next action (look at Current Phase, Stop Gate, `continuation_guard.next_required_action`, and Next Exact Batch above).
11. Check the clock. How much time budget remains? (If open-ended: unlimited.)
12. Resume immediately. Don't ask for help. Don't redo completed work.

The execution log is your proof of what is done. If something appears in the log as complete, it is
complete. Don't re-implement it.
